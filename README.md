# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing patterns and factors influencing hotel booking cancellations. The dataset includes features like booking lead time, market segment, room type, and customer demographic information. Let's understand this project using STAR technique: 

# Situation (S):

The hospitality industry faces high cancellation rates, leading to revenue losses and inefficient resource allocation. Hotels must deal with:

* Last-minute cancellations that result in empty rooms.
* No-shows impacting revenue and operational planning.
* Seasonal variations in booking trends affecting demand forecasting.

A detailed data-driven analysis was required to identify key patterns and reduce cancellation rates.

# Task (T):

The goal of this project was to analyze hotel booking cancellations and determine:
* Factors influencing cancellations (e.g., booking lead time, price, customer type).
* Differences between city hotels and resort hotels in terms of cancellation rates.
* Impact of guest behavior, payment method, and market segment on cancellations.
* Strategies to minimize cancellation rates and improve revenue.

# Action (A):

To achieve these objectives, the following steps were taken:

1. Data Collection & Cleaning:

Used a dataset containing hotel booking details (e.g., customer type, lead time, deposit type, cancellation status).Cleaned and processed data using Python (Pandas, NumPy) to remove missing values and standardize formats.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Used Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Power BI to visualize trends.
* Identified the cancellation rate

3️. Key Insights from Analysis:

* Longer lead times increase cancellation probability:
* Bookings made more than 90 days in advance had a 50% cancellation rate.
* Non-refundable bookings had lower cancellations:
* Guests who paid deposits had only a 10% cancellation rate, compared to 45% for non-deposit bookings.

# Result (R):

The analysis led to valuable business insights for hotel managers:
* ✅ Encouraging non-refundable bookings could reduce cancellations by 30-40%.
* ✅ Offering last-minute discounts for high lead-time bookings could reduce room wastage.
* ✅ Targeting OTA customers with personalized incentives could improve direct booking rates and lower cancellations.
* ✅ Helped create a data-driven strategy to optimize hotel revenue and operations.
